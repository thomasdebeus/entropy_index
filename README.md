Calculate segregation of multiple neighbourhoods and origins in the [city of Amsterdam](origins_inhabitants_amsterdam_2018.csv) with the Local Entropy Score (LES*u*).

The paper which uses above table and the `LESu` formula to create a segregation map of Philadelphia. I would like to calculate the entropy scores for each neigbourhood in the R language and create a similar map but then for Amsterdam.

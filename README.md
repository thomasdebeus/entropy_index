# entropy_index

Calculate segregation of multiple neighbourhoods and origins using the [data of Amsterdam](origins_inhabitants_amsterdam_2018.csv) and the Local Entropy Score (LES*u*) formula.

The paper which uses above table and the `LESu` formula to create a segregation map of Philadelphia. I would like to calculate the entropy scores for each neigbourhood in the R language and create a similar map but then for Amsterdam.
